## Technical Test for Jeff Ward

Code has been written with TDD and is a console app, written as a dotnetcore 2.2 console application, within the timeframe of 3 hours.

The scenarios mentioned in the spec are implemented as unit tests named Scenario1, Scenario2, Scenario3

The other tests in the solution were written as I was building components of the test, during the test.

I have implemented best practices such as SOLID principles and composition over inheritance.


Although this test was written on a mac, using rider, it should work fine in visial studio on Windows.



I have included two scripts to be able to run and test this outside of the IDE

```
build.sh 
```

and 

```
test.sh
```

Again these have only been tested on macos, but should work on windows
